# Player Fields Reference

This is the authoritative player-record field reference for the current codebase.

For container-level rules, use [../DATA_FORMATS.md](../DATA_FORMATS.md). For implementation details, cross-check [../../app/models.py](../../app/models.py), [../../app/io.py](../../app/io.py), and [../../app/file_writer.py](../../app/file_writer.py).

## Scope

This document describes the player data that the project can currently parse or write conservatively from `JUG98030.FDI`.

## Record Anchors

- Player data lives inside `.FDI` entry payloads and is parsed by `PlayerRecord.from_bytes()`.
- `team_id` is stored at bytes `0-1` (little-endian).
- `squad_number` is stored at byte `2`.
- The name region starts after byte `4`.

The current parser supports two complementary ideas:
- It first attempts a structured name read from the payload at offset `5` using two sequential length-prefixed strings (given name, then surname).
- Each structured string is stored as `uint16 length` followed by `length` bytes of `0x61`-XOR'd text.
- When structured parsing is incomplete or suspicious, it falls back to conservative name heuristics.
- Indexed `DMFIv1.0` JUG payloads also carry a second metadata block after the visible name suffix. The parser now uses that block when it validates cleanly.

Reverse-engineering notes and Ghidra validation indicate that the original game reads player records sequentially after the two strings. The `0x61 0x61 0x61 0x61` (`aaaa`) marker is therefore a conservative implementation anchor in the current write path, not a proven format boundary.

## Confirmed Parser-Backed Fields

## Identity

- `team_id`
  - Bytes `0-1`
  - Type: `uint16` little-endian
- `squad_number`
  - Byte `2`
  - Type: `uint8`
- `given_name`, `surname`, `name`
  - Extracted from the name region beginning at byte `5`
  - Backed by the raw payload so unknown surrounding bytes can be preserved

## Metadata (current conservative write anchor)

The current codebase rewrites these fields relative to the `aaaa` anchor when it can be found safely. This is a write-safety rule, not a claim that the underlying format is marker-based:

- `position_primary`
  - `marker + 7`
  - Stored XOR’d (`value ^ 0x61`)
- `nationality`
  - `marker + 8`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `birth_day`
  - `marker + 9`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `birth_month`
  - `marker + 10`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `birth_year`
  - `marker + 11` and `marker + 12`
  - Little-endian, XOR’d bytewise
- `height`
  - `marker + 13`
  - Stored XOR’d

## Metadata (indexed JUG suffix block)

For indexed `DMFIv1.0` JUG entries, the parser can also recover a richer metadata block anchored from the visible name suffix. Existing indexed payloads can now be rewritten conservatively in place through that same suffix block when the anchor validates.

- `nationality`
  - `name_suffix + 8`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `position_primary`
  - `name_suffix + 11`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `birth_day`
  - `name_suffix + 12`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `birth_month`
  - `name_suffix + 13`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `birth_year`
  - `name_suffix + 14` and `name_suffix + 15`
  - Little-endian, XOR’d bytewise
- `height`
  - `name_suffix + 16`
  - Stored XOR’d
- `weight`
  - `name_suffix + 17`
  - Stored XOR’d
  - Current evidence indicates this is kilograms in indexed JUG payloads

## Attributes

- The current parser reads up to 12 skill bytes from the trailing attribute window.
- The effective window is `len(payload) - 19` through `len(payload) - 7`.
- Each byte is XOR’d with `0x61` after outer payload decoding.
- Missing values are padded conservatively in memory for compatibility.
- Confirmed trailing-window mapping:
  - `attributes[3]` = `speed`
  - `attributes[4]` = `stamina`
  - `attributes[5]` = `aggression`
  - `attributes[6]` = `quality`
  - `attributes[7]` = `heading`
  - `attributes[8]` = `dribbling`
  - `attributes[9]` = `passing`
  - `attributes[10]` = `shooting`
  - `attributes[11]` = `tackling`
- `attributes[0]`, `attributes[1]`, and `attributes[2]` remain unresolved.
- The inspection surfaces now expose these three leading tail bytes as a read-only
  `tail_prefix=[a, b, c]` probe in both the CLI (`player-inspect`) and the GUI
  (`Inspect Player Metadata...`) so they can be compared across real records without
  pretending they are normal editable stats.
- The CLI now also exposes `player-tail-prefix-profile`, and the GUI surfaces the same
  data inside the `Tail Prefix` and `Tail Signatures` tabs of `Inspect Indexed Player Byte
  Profiles...`. This keeps the unresolved prefix inspectable with the same parser-backed
  filters already used for `u0/u1/u9/u10`, and it now also supports direct `a0/a1/a2`
  plus the confirmed byte immediately after weight (`post_weight_byte` / `postwt`)
  and the two post-attribute byte filters (`trail` and `sidecar`) so the current
  structural classes can be isolated without ad hoc scripts.
- `DBASEPRE.EXE`'s indexed parser helper (`FUN_0043d170`) now gives a useful negative
  result too: it writes the indexed suffix/physical fields into fixed player-struct
  offsets (`+0x20`, `+0x4C`, `+0x17..+0x1F`, `+0x16`, `+0x50..+0x53`, `+0x4E`, `+0x4F`),
  and it also copies the next encoded byte after weight into `[player + 0x48]`.
  That byte is now surfaced as the read-only `post_weight_byte` probe.
  A later helper (`FUN_0043d960`) tightens the interpretation: it checks
  `[player + 0x1D]` and `[player + 0x48]` against the same lookup value, and its
  known caller in `FUN_004319f0` sits inside the search-options builder where that
  value is resolved through the same `0x4B2E90` nationality table used by the
  player-view nationality label path at `0x00417583`.
  On the current anchored indexed corpus, `post_weight_byte` matches `nationality`
  on roughly 94% of parsed records, so the safest current reading is that it acts
  as a secondary nationality/search key, not a second physical stat.
  The remaining mismatches are also patterned rather than random. The dominant
  divergence currently clusters around `postwt=30` paired with nearby nationality
  IDs such as `31`, `45`, `19`, and `32`, which suggests a fallback/grouped lookup
  behavior rather than corrupt data. The shared profile now also surfaces the top
  divergent `postwt` values directly; `30` is currently the dominant grouped search
  key in the mismatch subset. The CLI/GUI inspect surfaces now annotate the obvious
  per-record mirror case as a nationality-search mirror, and the non-mirror minority
  as grouped nationality-search keys.
  but it does not expose the trailing 12-byte attribute window as a comparable set of
  fixed struct-byte writes there. Instead, once it reaches the late opaque region it
  copies a larger trailing block into a player sidecar area in bulk (starting at
  `[player + 0x70]`, after loading two bytes into `[player + 0x6E]` / `[player + 0x6F]`).
  Those two pre-sidecar bytes are now surfaced as separate read-only probes:
  `trail` (the fixed trailer byte after `attributes[3..11]`) and `sidecar`
  (the first byte of the remaining copied sidecar tail).
  Separate UI paths in `DBASEPRE.EXE` also read `[player + 0x6E]` and `[player + 0x6F]`
  individually and render them as standalone one-byte values, which strengthens the
  case that these are real subfields even though their labels are still unknown.
  That is why the tail prefix is currently treated as a structural signature / sidecar
  probe rather than a normal named stat. The same caution applies to
  `post_weight_byte`: it is fixed and parser-backed, and likely nationality-adjacent,
  but still not safe to rename as a normal editable field.
- `handling` is part of the separate `dd6361` visible-skill trailer contract, not this 12-byte player-record tail.
- The GUI now treats `attributes[0..2]` as read-only probe bytes and only exposes `attributes[3..11]`
  as normal editable fields.

## Write Rules and Constraints

- Preserve `raw_data` whenever possible; unknown bytes should survive unchanged.
- Do not assume arbitrary player-name expansion is safe.
- Metadata writes must not happen if the `aaaa` anchor cannot be located.
- Indexed JUG metadata writes must not happen if the suffix anchor cannot be located safely.
- Attribute writes must remain within the trailing attribute window.
- If a write would change record size, directory offsets and header state must be updated through the existing safe writers.

## Known / Partial / Unknown

## Known

- `team_id`
- `squad_number`
- name region handling
- `position_primary`
- `nationality`
- `birth_day`
- `birth_month`
- `birth_year`
- `height`
- `weight` (indexed JUG payloads, plus legacy records with a dedicated marker-backed slot)
- trailing attribute window

## Partial

- The exact internal name encoding varies across records; the parser handles multiple shapes conservatively.
- `weight` is now parser-backed for indexed `DMFIv1.0` JUG payloads and for non-indexed / legacy records only when the conservative marker anchor exposes a real extra byte at `name_end + 14` before the trailing attribute window. In those legacy cases the same in-place slot is writable too. Canonical synthesized records still do not emit this extra byte, so they remain weightless unless a real slot already exists in `raw_data`.
- `DBASEPRE.EXE` player-view code also treats the in-memory physical stat bytes as adjacent values: it reads `[player + 0x4E]` as a centimetre height value (then converts it to feet/inches for display) and `[player + 0x4F]` as a raw weight-like value after drawing the `HEIGHT` / `WEIGHT` labels. That strongly corroborates the indexed JUG `height`/`weight` mapping.
- `DBASEPRE.EXE`'s indexed player parser helper (`FUN_0043d170`) also places the first two bytes of the indexed suffix block into struct offsets `[player + 0x20]` and `[player + 0x4C]`. These bytes are now surfaced as raw `indexed_unknown_0` / `indexed_unknown_1` probe values.
- `DBASEPRE.EXE` portrait rendering also confirms that indexed suffix bytes `name_suffix + 2 .. + 7` are the variable-length face-component sequence used to build the player head graphic.
- Indexed suffix bytes `name_suffix + 9` and `+10` are now surfaced as raw `indexed_unknown_9` / `indexed_unknown_10` values. They behave like low-cardinality categorical flags, but their gameplay meaning is still unresolved.
- The `player-inspect` CLI path exposes the indexed suffix anchor and these raw probe bytes directly for real-record comparisons.
- The GUI now exposes the same confirmed indexed snapshot through `Inspect Player Metadata...`, using the same parser-backed backend contract as `player-inspect` in a structured dialog.
- In the full GUI, these confirmed player inspection surfaces now render into the persistent `Analysis` tab workspace instead of living only in transient popups.
- When a matching local reference still exists under `.local/PlayerStills/*.png`, that dialog now also surfaces it as an optional visual cross-check. This is a GUI aid only, not part of the binary contract.
- The `player-leading-profile` CLI path aggregates the unresolved leading byte pair (`indexed_unknown_0` / `indexed_unknown_1`) across the indexed JUG dataset for the same kind of cohort analysis, and it can now be filtered by `u0` / `u1` as well as `u9` / `u10`.
- Current evidence suggests the leading pair behaves differently from `u9/u10`: `indexed_unknown_0` is much higher-cardinality (dozens of values in the anchored dataset), while `indexed_unknown_1` is often `0` but does take non-zero values.
- `DBASEPRE.EXE` also has a direct player-list UI consumer for `[player + 0x4C]`: it reads the byte and maps it into row colors. In the indexed subset, the observed values currently collapse to `0`, `1`, `2`, and `4`, with `4` normalized into the same display bucket as `1`. That makes `indexed_unknown_1` look like a compact display/status class, even though the underlying gameplay meaning is still not named.
- A position cross-check on the anchored indexed subset rules out the simplest alternative explanation: `indexed_unknown_1` spans all main position codes (`0`..`3`) rather than collapsing to a single coarse position group. It may still be used for presentation, but it is not just a hidden position-color byte.
- `DBASEPRE.EXE`'s player-list builders (`FUN_0042a430` and `FUN_0042e330`) also use the leading pair as guard bytes before adding players to sortable UI lists. They reject records when `[player + 0x4C] == 3`, and they branch on `[player + 0x20]` against `0x62` / `0x63`. In the current anchored indexed JUG subset, those guard values do not appear (`u0` currently tops out at `31`, and `u1` is only `0`, `1`, `2`, or `4`), so these look like reserved or non-listable sentinel states rather than normal live values.
- `indexed_unknown_0` remains the more likely fine-grained variant selector within that class.
- The `player-suffix-profile` CLI path aggregates these unresolved byte pairs across the indexed JUG dataset, with optional nationality/position filters for hypothesis testing.
- The GUI now also exposes the same confirmed read-side profile data through `Inspect Indexed Player Byte Profiles...`, combining the current `player-suffix-profile` and `player-leading-profile` views into one structured stateful dialog.
- That same GUI profile view now also includes the unresolved `tail_prefix` buckets, using
  the same filters and backed by the same indexed parser path as the CLI
  `player-tail-prefix-profile` command.
- In the full GUI, that profile view also renders in the persistent `Analysis` tab so the latest parser-backed inspection data stays visible while editing.
- That profile dialog also records when the sampled example names have matching local still assets, so the current byte-bucket hypotheses can be cross-checked against the local screenshot set without affecting the underlying parser contract.
- Current working hypothesis only: `indexed_unknown_9` behaves like an appearance tone bucket, and `indexed_unknown_10` behaves like a hair/palette bucket. This is investigation guidance, not a safe write contract.
- Current tail-prefix evidence is stronger for a structural signature than for user-facing
  stats. For example, on the current `JUG98030.FDI` corpus filtered to `u1=1`, the top
  buckets are `[77, 81, 107]` (`132` records), `[1, 0, 25]` (`96`), and
  `[77, 80, 107]` (`56`). That clustering is real and useful for reverse engineering, but
  it still does not map cleanly to named visible fields like `fitness` or `morale`.
- The new per-byte histogram view strengthens that same conclusion:
  - `Attr 0` is highly skewed toward `77`, with a smaller secondary family at `1`
  - `Attr 1` has several real buckets (`81`, `0`, `80`, `83`, `76`, ...)
  - `Attr 2` is almost binary on the anchored indexed corpus (`107` vs `25`)
  This makes `Attr 2` look more like a class marker than a normal user-facing stat, but
  it is still not safe to name until a real binary consumer is identified.
  The direct `a2` filter makes that split even stronger:
  - `a2=25` currently collapses to the single dominant family `[1, 0, 25]` (`308` records)
  - `a2=107` covers the remaining larger family set (`1646` records), where `Attr 0` and
    `Attr 1` still vary materially
  Adding the fixed trailer byte refines that further:
  - `a2=25` with `trail=19` isolates the dominant combined signature
    `[1, 0, 25 | trail=19]` (`182` records)
  - the remaining `a2=25` records retain the same `tail_prefix` but split across other
    trailer-byte values, which makes the trailer byte a useful secondary discriminator
    even though it is still unresolved.
  Adding the second pre-sidecar byte refines that dominant branch again:
  - `[1, 0, 25 | trail=19 sidecar=0]` currently contains `161` records
  - `[1, 0, 25 | trail=19 sidecar=1]` currently contains `21` records
  So `sidecar` is now a parser-backed tertiary discriminator on top of the current
  `Attr 2` and `trail` split, even though it remains unnamed.
  The newly surfaced `post_weight_byte` is also a useful cohort discriminator:
  on the current corpus, the dominant `a2=25` + `trail=19` branch is still mostly
  `postwt=30`, which makes it a stable read-only filter even before it has a
  semantic label.
  Across the broader anchored indexed set, `post_weight_byte` matches `nationality`
  on about `94%` of rows, which is why the current tooling now treats it as a
  secondary nationality/search byte rather than part of the physical-stat contract.
  The CLI and GUI inspect surfaces now also annotate the obvious per-record case where
  `post_weight_byte == nationality`, so that mirror relationship is visible without
  having to run a separate profile command.
  The shared profile surface now also reports the top mismatch pairs and the top
  divergent `postwt` keys directly, so the non-mirror minority can be tracked
  without ad hoc scripts.
- The indexed tail layout itself is now partially formalized:
  - on the current anchored indexed corpus, the conservative layout walker verifies the
    same split on `1921` records, with `33` remaining mismatches / unparsed layouts
  - `attributes[0..2]` are the last three bytes of the final variable-length block payload
  - `attributes[3..11]` are the following nine bytes in the fixed trailer
  - the parser then skips one additional trailer byte, leaving the final six bytes as
    trailing padding / post-trailer data
  This is a structural mapping, not a semantic one, but it explains why the front of the
  attribute window behaves differently from the named stats.
- The `player-edit` CLI path now supports in-place indexed renames as well as the confirmed `DMFIv1.0` metadata fields. On non-indexed player files it also supports the conservative marker-backed fields (`position_primary`, `nationality`, `birth_*`, `height`) and now `weight` too, but only when the selected record already exposes a real parser-backed legacy weight slot. `player-batch-edit` applies the same contract from a CSV plan.
- `player-inspect` now also works on non-indexed player files. On those legacy shapes it exposes the
  same conservative marker-backed fields through the shared inspection path, leaves indexed-only
  suffix fields empty, and now also surfaces `weight` when the record has a real marker-backed slot.
- `player-legacy-weight-profile` now uses the indexed suffix-weight field as a control set to test
  old marker-relative candidate offsets. On the current indexed corpus, `marker + 14` is the only
  serious candidate: it exactly matches the trusted indexed `weight` in `742 / 1464` control records
  (`50.68%`), while `marker + 15 .. + 18` are effectively noise. Across that same control set,
  `marker + 13` still remains the only viable height baseline (`50.20%` exact). That makes
  the legacy `marker + 14` promotion a structural consequence of the already-accepted marker-backed
  height slot, not just a loose statistical guess.
- `player-legacy-weight-profile` now also reports a second validation pass over the real name-only
  parser path (`gather_player_records`) for the same file, counting how many valid parsed records
  expose the legacy slot and how often those parser-backed weights agree with uniquely matched
  indexed records. On the current `JUG98030.FDI` corpus, that name-only cross-check is much
  stronger than the pure control set: `2470` valid parsed records expose the slot, `492` map
  uniquely to indexed records, and `447 / 492` of those (`90.85%`) agree exactly. The GUI
  exposes the same summary and candidate table inside
  `Inspect Indexed Player Byte Profiles...`.
- Indexed JUG metadata is now writable in place for existing records, but canonical synthesized records still do not emit this suffix block.
- The trailing 12-byte attribute window is now partially stabilized: slots `3 .. 11` are strongly
  corroborated against the `dd6361` visible-skill index, while slots `0 .. 2` are still unresolved.

## Unknown or Not Yet Safe

- Contract-related fields
- Any unknown metadata bytes outside the confirmed offsets
- Structural rewrites that rely on undocumented player-record variants

## Safety Notes

- Historical investigations showed that player-name storage is structurally sensitive. Incorrect assumptions about string layout can corrupt the file.
- The original game appears to read the record sequentially, so name edits and metadata edits should be treated as whole-record structural work, not arbitrary byte pokes around a presumed delimiter.
- Current write paths should therefore be treated as conservative overlays, not as permission to freely synthesize or reflow record internals.
